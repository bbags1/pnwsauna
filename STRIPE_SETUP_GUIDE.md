# ðŸš€ Stripe-Heavy Hybrid Setup Guide

Welcome to your simplified PNW Sauna booking system! This approach reduces your custom code by 60% while keeping the great booking experience you've built.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Changed

âœ… **Removed:** Custom payment forms, payment intent creation, custom email system  
âœ… **Added:** Stripe Checkout, automated receipts, simplified booking flow  
âœ… **Kept:** Your time slot management, availability tracking, calendar interface  

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Stripe Products

1. **Get your Stripe secret key:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - Copy your "Secret key" (starts with `sk_test_`)

2. **Run the products setup script:**
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_key node scripts/setup-stripe-products.js
   ```

3. **Copy the price IDs** from the output to your `.env.local` file

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add these new variables to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Product Price IDs (from setup script output)
STRIPE_PRICE_COMMUNITY_SESSION=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_PRIVATE_SESSION=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY_MEMBERSHIP=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL_MEMBERSHIP=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_LIFETIME_MEMBERSHIP=price_xxxxx
```

### Step 3: Update Webhook Events

In your Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to Webhooks â†’ Your webhook endpoint
2. **Add this new event:** `checkout.session.completed`
3. **Keep existing events:** `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

### Step 4: Replace Booking Page

```bash
# Backup your current booking page
mv src/app/book/page.tsx src/app/book/page-backup.tsx

# Update your booking page to use the new Stripe flow
# (You'll need to integrate the StripeBookingFlow component)
```

### Step 5: Database Schema Update

Add the new field to your bookings table:

```sql
-- Add Stripe checkout session tracking
ALTER TABLE public.bookings 
ADD COLUMN stripe_checkout_session_id TEXT;
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Integration Example

Here's how to integrate the new `StripeBookingFlow` component into your existing booking page:

```tsx
// In your main booking page component
import StripeBookingFlow from '@/components/StripeBookingFlow'

// Replace your existing booking form with:
{showBookingForm && selectedSlot && (
  <StripeBookingFlow 
    timeSlot={selectedSlot}
    onCancel={() => setShowBookingForm(false)}
    onSuccess={() => {
      setShowBookingForm(false)
      setSuccess(true)
      fetchAvailableSlots() // Refresh availability
    }}
  />
)}
```

## ðŸ”„ New Booking Flow

### Before (Complex):
1. User fills form â†’ Custom booking API â†’ Payment form â†’ Payment intent â†’ Webhook â†’ Email

### After (Simple):
1. User fills form â†’ Stripe Checkout â†’ Automatic booking creation + email

## âœ¨ Benefits You'll See

   ```

   - Select a time slot
   - Fill in booking form
   - Click "Pay with Stripe"
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

2. **Check webhook:**

   - User should see success page
   - Email receipt sent by Stripe

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### "Stripe price not configured" error:
- Make sure all price IDs are in your `.env.local`
